		So you hit the kitchen and start washing, cursing yourself 
		for not being more careful. You look over and see a woman, she's smiling.
		You talk to her, and ask her how long she's worked here. She says she
		doesn't, she's just didn't realize it was so expensive, and now she has to 
		work off her debt. The two of you have a good laugh about the situation 
		you're both in, and the work doesn't seem so grueling anymore. When it's 
		all done, neither of you are ready to leave. So you make plans to 
		not-check-the-price again next weekend.
