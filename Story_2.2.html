		This bar was a rude wake up call: it's loud, crowded, and kinda stinky.
		There's a crowd of people hovering around a karaoke machine singing <i>Sweet Caroline</i>.
		They're super drunk, but they do look like they're having fun. It wouldn't hurt
		to get out of your comfort zone a bit and join them. Then again, you always feel
		comfortable just sitting in the corner and watching people out the window.
