			You try to kick at the raving news anchor, but he is swifter
			than you assumed. He grabs your leg with a vice grip, and no
			matter how you struggle, he pulls harder and harder. You look 
			back at the empty couch in your living room, and reach for the 
			remote, but it's too late. You are in a news room now, wearing 
			a suit. You have make-up on. On the desk in front of you there 
			is paper with the days events listed on it. You are now a news 
			anchor, and for 24 hours a day you deliver the news.There's no 
			time to wonder how this happened, you're on air in thirty seconds. 
			Who is going to take care of your cat?
