		My god that was a tasty breakfast: the bread was so fresh you could 
		smell it from the kitchen, The berries were picked from the roof-top garden, 
		and the yolk from the free-range eggs ran like a river onto your buttered toast.
		You get the bill and it's <em>$117.55</em>. How could this happen? You only brought 
		thirteen dollars. You must've gotten so caught up in the aroma you didn't even 
		check the price! You explain to the manager, and she says you can work off your 
		debt washing dishes. That's not so bad, but the again, you could just leave. 
		What are they going to do, call the cops?
