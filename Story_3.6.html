		You heed God's word, and what do you know? You're a star!
		You're like a Kardashian or something. All of a sudden the world 
		wants to know what you're up to. So, you write a book, and it's
		a national best seller, and you do a book tour, and you sign a 
		bunch of books, and your life changes completely. You still have
		bad days, but this worked out pretty well. To think, you almost
		threw it all away, literally.
