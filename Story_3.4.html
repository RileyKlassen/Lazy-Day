			As you order another Old Fashioned, and look out the window, you notice 
			things seems to be moving faster than normal. You swivel back around and 
			find that that bar has cleared out. You're alone, and you have to pee. 
			You go to the bathroom, and as you wash your hands, you look in the mirror.
			You see a reflection of yourself, only it's not the <i>You</i> you know. You're the 
			same person, but between the window and the bathroom you must've aged 40 years.
