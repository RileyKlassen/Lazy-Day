		You pour your cereal in to a bowl and add milk. About half way through
		your meal, you look down and see something peculiar: the letter shaped cereal
		pieces spell out your name. A moment later, they rearange and read a different
		message. This one says 'It is I, God'. The cheap snack continues, explaining that
		you are the child of God. Not until you showed initiative by getting out of bed
		early and going to the bar less did she choose to make contact. The cereal declares 
		it is time for you to attend your heavenly duties. This whole thing sounds a little
		bit like a scam, but then, maybe it's true. Will you heed god's call?
