		You grab the man by his neck tie, and pull as hard as you can. 
		He slides out of the TV set, and wiggles around on the floor for 
		moment while he loosens his tie. He gets up and explains that he
		has been trapped in that news studio for months, and he can't remember
		how he got there. He says they will be looking for him, and asks if
		he can lay low at your apartment for a while. You can see from the look
		in his eyes, he's not joking. You grab two beers out of the fridge,
		give him one, and ask him what the hell is going on?
