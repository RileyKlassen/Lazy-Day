			No time to waste, you hop out of bed and head for the kitchen.
			You look in the fridge, but there's not much there. You forgot to go
			grocery shopping yesterday. On the counter there's a box of Alphabits cereal.
			It wouldn't be the worst thing in a pinch. You remember that fancy cafe that
			just opened, maybe you could try it?
