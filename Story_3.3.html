			You're tired of holding back, you want to be the guy who
			turns heads, and that starts tonight. You push your way through
			the crowd and call next on the mic. It's your turn, and the song
			you choose is <i>Wuthering Heights</i> by Kate Bush. You get up 
			on stage and and look out on the crowd. Oh God, what have I done?
			I can't sing! I can't do this! But the crowd begins to chant:
			'Come home, Cathy. Come home, Cathy!' There's no backing down. 
			You close your eyes, do your best Falsetto, and hope for the best...
			When you open your eyes, everyone's mouth is on the floor, and you
			can't tell if they loved it or hated it, but they're screaming and
			carrying you around the bar. One thing is certain, 
			you turned some heads.
