		What The Fuck!?! As you sit there watching the news you loose focus,
		and fiddle with the remote. You are startled by a <b>loud human shriek!</b>
		You look up and the news anchor who was speaking just a few moments ago
		is now coming out of the TV and making swiping, grabbing motions while
		looking directly into your eyes. He looks mad, but also... frightened.
